r"""
We want a "patch_area" for each patch.
The patch_area is a cube (strictly speaking, rectangular parallelepiped)
that covers the patch.

The earth (or the celestial sphere) is embedded in a 3D orthogonal coordinate
system, and the edges of the "cube" must be parallel to the coordinates.

So far is the setup of this quiz.

Now, let's begin with assuming the "patch_area" is the minimal cube that
encompasses the four vertices of the patch.  Here is a problem: the patch is
not flat but curved.

Suppose the patch has the following shape when seen from upside:
                    B
                 /     \
             /             \
           A                 C    (rectangular!)
             \             /
                 \     /
                    D
But when seen horizontally, it is curved downwards:
           A                 C
             \             /      (curved downwards!)
                ---------
Then, "the minimal cube that encompasses the four vertices (A,B,C,D)" is
the thin area depicted by ====:

           A=================C
             \             /
                ---------

The cube does not cover the curved patch.

To address the problem, we simply add a "margin" in all directions.
With an appropriate margin, the cube will be:
      -----------------------------   ^
      |                           |   | margin
      |    A                 C    |   x
      |      \             /      |   | margin
      -----------------------------   v
And the cube now covers the patch.

Another problem is that the edges AB, BC, CD, DA are not straight.
Still, they are great circles: for they are straight in a gnomonic
projection.

Imagine a bow-shape seen from a fixed viewpoint, and rotate the bow around
its chord.  When does the deviation between the bow and the chord look the
largest?  It is when the bow-shape's normal vector is head-on to the
viewpoint:

                chord
           A-------------B    ^
             \         /      | deviation
               -------  bow   v

This deviation can also be absorbed by adding a similar margin:

      -------------------------   ^
      |                       |   | margin
      |    A-------------B    |   x
      |      \         /      |   | margin
      -------------------------   v

In both two cases, the margins are equal to the "versine" part of the bow-shapes.
(versine = 1 - cosine)

Which of the two "versine" is the larger?  Since the curvature radii of the
bows are the same (= earth's radius) in both cases, the longer the chord, the
larger the versine.  Therefore, that of the first case is the larger.
In that case, the length of the chord is

    2r = max(AC, BD)

where AC and BD are distances in the orthogonal coordinates (not on the
sphere).  From "r", the margin is given by:

    margin = R (1 - cos(asin(r/R))) = R - sqrt(R^2 - r^2)
        = r^2 / (R + sqrt(R^2 - r^2))

where R is the radius of the earth.
